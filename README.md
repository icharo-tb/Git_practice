# Git Practice 

- This is my personal space where I study and practice different tools:
	- Python
	- MongoDB
	- ETL processes
	- PySpark Notebooks
- It is in general a safe place to study and share my learning path.
- I called it Git since I upload all my content using git (quite obvious :smile: )

- The gallery is divided in four branches, but the important ones are:
	- learnbranch (where I upload almost everything)
	- mongodb (Mainly mongo operations)
